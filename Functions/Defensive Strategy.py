""" 
This file contains an program that implements the simple (and as we saw, defeatable)
algorithm to play TicTacToe. This is the last file for lesson one.

We'll see how almost with no new functions, the defensive strategy can be implemented.
You're playing as the TicTacMan/Woman. 
 
Next, I'll be putting up the code for the unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe strategy, along with
a HUGE accompanying lesson on recursion, and graphs. I promise it'll be very interesting.
Stay tuned!
