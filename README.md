# TicTacTongue

TicTacTongue is an educational project with the goal of assembling Earth's Mightiest Zeros - an unbeatable TicTacToe algorithm. (That's the mission)

This repo is mainly for members of the BVN CS Mailing List, though any beginner in CS is welcome. It takes off where we left the first workshop, and introduces the concept of functions, or methods in a programming language. 

Contents have been subdivided into directories based on the topics covered.

## Functions

This is the first topic covered after the workshop.

Visit the files in the following order:

* Functions.py
* Library.py
* ExtendedAPI.py
* Defensive Strategy.py
* Game.py

Your job is to go through the files and complete ExtendedAPI.py and Game.py.

## Recursion and Classes

Visit the files in the following order:

* ExtendedAPI.py (slightly different from Functions/ExtendedAPI.py)
* Gamestate.py
* AI.py	

AI.py is the file that you need to run, to play against the Earth's Mightiest Zeros.				

## Dependencies

You need to have Python 2.7.x installed on your system.
