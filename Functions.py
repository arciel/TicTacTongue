This code will help you understand the workings of TicTacTongue. 
You'll write your own strategy (algorithm), and play against it. 

Make sure you read the syntax and the readme file before starting here.

Remember: The instructions - your team - is called Earth's Mightiest Zeros! 
It will be important later (when you realize just how awesome Marvel is).

Reading code can be a little dry - but don't give up! Read this file, please.

# NOTE: The words 'line' and 'instruction' have been used interchangeably, as,
# mostly, in a program, there is one instruction per line (roughly). 
# May or may not be true for individual lines. Sometimes, two or even three 
# instructions can be on one line. But we'll assume there's just one per line.

# A function (or a method) is a set of instructions. Now, why do we use 
# functions? A very common example is this - say you want to do something that 
# takes a couple of instructions (say 10). And you want to do it many times, 
# at different places in your code. 

# Now, if you make a function of those instructions, instead of 
# writing those same (or similar) 10 lines everywhere in your code, you can 
# write the 10 lines once, and CALL the function of those 10 lines everywhere.

# Calling a function takes only one line, so, if you needed that code in 20 
# places, instead of 200 lines, you use only 21. This makes reading and 
# maintaining code much easier and better.

# we stacked those rows upon one-another. Remember, numbering of rows as well as

# Now, you have used if, while, isCross and put. So, did you use TicTacTongue,
# or Python? Haha. Well, rest assured, you actually used Python. TicTacTongue, 
# can conceptually be a language, but, it really is a very trivial library, 
# written in Python. 

# A library is basically a set of functions (and other stuff) that extend the 
# functionality of a language. You write a library so that if you ever have to 
# use that code again, you don't have to re-write it. And you can share it with
# others, who won't have to write it from scratch.

# After this, head to Library.py!
